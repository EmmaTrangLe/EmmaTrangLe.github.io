        <h3>Project Objectives</h3>
        <p>This project aims to comprehensively investigate the impact of oil discharges through punctures on the
            surrounding environment. To achieve this, the study will initially track the distance traveled by oil from
            its puncture points. Subsequently, the accumulated oil puddles that form during the discharge will be
            identified. These specific locations of oil puddles will serve as critical reference points for analyzing
            the dispersion of fumes and their reach from the oil puddles, taking into account wind direction data.
        </p>
        <h3> Workflow </h3>
        <p>
            The initial simulation centers around a hypothetical oil rupture point, as the pipeline in question
            is
            still in the conceptual phase. No actual data files are available, aside from an official route map.
            Consequently, the pipeline structure is manually constructed using 3D objects (pipes) sourced from
            Sketchup. The primary purpose of this simulation is to visualize the trajectory of oil dispersion
            following an abrupt puncture event.

        </p>
        In contrast, the second simulation places emphasis on the movement of fumes originating from the oil
        puddles identified in the first simulation. To accurately represent this phenomenon, the simulation
        incorporates wind data, specifically, wind direction (South & South East) and speed. These
        environmental
        factors play a crucial role in determining the potential hazard range of fumes due to turbulent
        mixing
        and interactions with nearby objects. The visualization of fume movement is achieved through a
        particle
        system integrated into Unity3D. This second simulation is essential as it sheds light on the
        significant
        risk associated with pipeline punctures - the dispersion of hazardous fumes.

        <h3>Findings</h3>
        <p>
            The initial findings from this work indicate that oil flow tends to accumulate in troughs and corners, while
            fumes travel approximately 1 kilometer southward. Furthermore, it suggests that adding an emergency valve
            could help reduce the radius of the affected area in the event of a pipeline rupture. These findings hold
            significant importance for the fields of 3D Geographic Information Science (GIScience) and 3D geovisual
            analysis, as they demonstrate the capability to capture and simulate dynamic phenomena, enabling users to
            actively engage with simulations and explore various scenarios. In practical applications, such simulations
            can serve as valuable tools for raising awareness about pipeline damage risks, educating the public, and
            testing different rupture scenarios to plan mitigation strategies that prioritize resident safety, protect
            local habitats, and preserve biodiversity.
