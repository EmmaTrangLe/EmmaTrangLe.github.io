        <h3>Abstract</h3>
        <p>This paper's primary objective is to identify new, suitable habitats for the endangered sea otters. Our study
            focused on Vancouver Island, utilizing both spatial and multi-criteria approaches. We employed a
            comprehensive array of methods in this endeavor, including Reclass, Fuzzy, Weight, and Multi-criteria
            Evaluation.
            <br><br>
            The Reclass operation enabled us to assign appropriate values to various variables, facilitating the
            quantification of habitat suitability. The Fuzzy operation played a critical role in standardizing
            continuous data, ensuring consistency and comparability. Through the Weight operation, we determined the
            relative importance of these factors in relation to each other.
            <br><br>
            Multi-criteria evaluation, a powerful technique, allowed us to assess and consolidate multiple criteria
            simultaneously. Through the integration of these methods, we produced a final map that identifies regions
            meeting all the essential criteria for an ideal sea otter habitat.

        <h3> Introduction </h3>
        <p>
            Despite being keystone species, sea otters are classified as a matter of special concern by the Committee on
            the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada (COSEWIC). As of a population survey in 2004, British Columbia
            is home to approximately 3,200 sea otters, primarily concentrated along the west coast of West Vancouver.
            While this increase in numbers is promising, the population remains small and in a recovery stage, facing
            persistent threats such as oil spills and human disturbances like illegal fishing and hunting.
            <br><br>
            The sea otter recovery program holds significant importance, as it seeks to establish a robust and
            well-distributed sea otter population along the British Columbian coast, capable of withstanding
            catastrophic threats such as oil spills. This proactive approach aims to reduce the risk of population
            decline or extinction due to coastal constraints. To achieve this, sea otters require new and secure
            habitats throughout the British Columbian coast. Previous surveys have primarily focused on assessing sea
            otters' resilience to oil spill threats, with less attention given to identifying suitable recovery and
            survival habitats.
            <br><br>
            Our approach involves considering various favorable factors and constraints to determine the most
            appropriate areas for sea otter repopulation. Utilizing the Weight module in TerrSet, we assign weights to
            favorable criteria and rank them based on their significance. The Weight Linear Combination within the
            Multi-Criteria Module of TerrSet assesses the relative importance of these weighted criteria, resulting in a
            comprehensive multi-criteria solution. This approach allows us to create a single evaluation index for
            identifying suitable recovery areas for sea otters, taking into account multiple factors and their
            respective weights.

        <h4>Methods</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Polygon to raster tool: converts shapefiles to raster data
            </li>
            <li>Reclass: Constraints (0 and 1 classes)
            </li>
            <li>Fuzzy: factors (a range from 0 to 1)
            </li>
            <li>Buffer: creates buffers of 4 km around constraints
            </li>
            <li>Weight module: Ranks factors (figure 2)</li>
            <li>MCE module: generates suitable regions
            </li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        In this assessment, we assigned varying degrees of importance to three key factors. Food availability,
        encompassing both fish stocks and kelp availability, received the highest weight, accounting for approximately
        77% of the assessment. This emphasis reflects the critical role of food in sustaining and facilitating the
        recovery of sea otter populations. Kelp, in particular, serves as a vital habitat for sea urchins and various
        marine species that form a substantial part of the sea otter diet.
        <br><br>
        On the other hand, the factor of protected areas was allocated a weight of 23%. This allocation acknowledges the
        importance of safeguarding sea otter habitats and providing the necessary protection for these vulnerable
        creatures to thrive.

        <p>
            The data utilized in the analysis originally existed in vector format and needed to be transformed into
            raster format for utilization. This rasterization process, however, resulted in a loss of spatial accuracy,
            leading to potential errors in various aspects, including area, perimeter, shape, structure, position, and
            attributes, given the numerous polygon features involved in the conversion. Furthermore, the initial raster
            data did not share the same projection as the base map, necessitating a conversion to NAD 1983 BC
            Environment Albers projection using the "Project" tool within ArcMap.
        </p>

        <p>

            The MCE analysis comprehensively examines the interplay of various factors and constraints to pinpoint
            optimal regions for implementing the sea otter population recovery program, with the overarching goal of
            elevating the mammal's population beyond the threshold of 3,500 (as illustrated in Figure 3).
        </p>

        <p>
            The western coast of Vancouver Island offers a more abundant expanse of suitable areas for sea otter
            recovery, primarily attributed to the presence of richer fish stocks, thriving kelp communities, and a
            greater number of protected zones along this side of the island. Our final suitability map reveals a
            prevalence of moderately suitable areas in comparison to high-suitability zones, partly due to the proximity
            of oil wells and the influence of tidal currents.
            <br><br>
            One notable exception is Bligh Island, which stands out as a highly suitable area, meeting all the essential
            requirements for sea otters in terms of fish and kelp availability while remaining shielded from constraints
            such as oil wells and tidal currents (as depicted in Figure 4).
            <br><br>
            It is worth acknowledging that the data processing involved in this analysis is intricate and can introduce
            potential sources of error. Additionally, the Weighted Linear Combination MCE considered only two
            constraints and three factors, whereas real-world decision-making in this context often involves a multitude
            of factors and constraints. Moreover, the vector data used in the analysis originated from diverse sources,
            making it challenging to assess the credibility of data quality across the board.
        </p>
        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <p>
            Sea otters, facing the threat of endangerment, urgently require a safe and nurturing environment to thrive.
            The outcome of the MCE analysis has favored areas where three crucial factors are optimized while
            constraints are minimized. As a result, the multifaceted solution from the MCE analysis will pinpoint
            suitable and safeguarded regions for sea otters. These regions offer ample kelp and food resources while
            providing protection against potential oil spill incidents and high tides.
            <br><br>
            Enhancing the data collection process by sourcing all data from a single, unified repository and ensuring
            consistent projection could have substantially reduced potential errors. Moreover, a more comprehensive
            consideration of additional on-ground factors and constraints would have yielded suitability areas that
            better reflect real-world conditions. It's important to note that the relative weights assigned to each
            factor were determined based on literature references and our best judgment. In practice, these weights
            might vary, potentially leading to different outcomes in this analysis.</p>
